If Covid-19 has pushed traditional art galleries, auction houses, and museums to make a digital shift, it is also shaking up the Indian digital art scene. In the lockdown, one of the flag bearers of tech-infused art found a firmer footing in the virtual world.

The pandemic has forced us to find ways to keep ourselves purposeful by upskilling and adding new dimensions to our works, such experiments are now finding takers in the mainstream. Brands from FMCG to apparel are scouting digital creators.

## NON - FUNGIBLE TOKENS:

NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens, digital tokens tied to assets that can be bought, sold, and traded are enabling artists to profit from their work more easily than ever. NFTs are having their big-bang moment, collectors and speculators have spent more than $200 million on an array of NFT-based artwork, memes, and GIFs.

The top NFT artwork is a hot topic right now, as NFT sales hit the headlines and everyone is wondering what all the fuss is about. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the newest way to trade collectibles and encompass art forms ranging from digital art to GIFs to music and beyond. Essentially, anything that can be thought of to hold value and can be stored digitally can be sold as an NFT. Crucially, NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain (Ethereum is a type of cryptocurrency), and the data stored inside the file holds value, sometimes a lot of value.

## BEEPLE EVERYDAYS : THE FIRST 5000 DAYS SOLD FOR $69.3M

Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, sold a piece for a record-setting $69 million at famed auction house Christie’s on March 11 the third-highest price ever fetched by any currently living artist, after Jeff Koons and David Hockney.

In theory, anyone can tokenize their work to sell it as an NFT. While NFT technology prevents it from being duplicated, there’s nothing that controls who can make an NFT in the first place. While people cannot hang their purchase over the mantle, it does come with huge ‘bragging rights’, touted as one of the main drivers behind investing in NFTs. If a relatively unknown artist called Beeple can become one of the most important and valuable living artists due to blockchain technology, what’s stopping us from trying our luck too?

NFTs are best understood as computer files combined with proof of ownership and authenticity, like a deed. Like cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, they exist on a blockchain a tamper-resistant digital public ledger. But like dollars, cryptocurrencies are “fungible,” meaning one bitcoin is always worth the same as any other bitcoin. By contrast, NFTs have unique valuations set by the highest bidder, just like a Rembrandt or a Picasso. Artists who want to sell their work as NFTs have to sign up with a marketplace, then “mint” digital tokens by uploading and validating their information on a blockchain, Doing so usually costs anywhere from $40 to $200. They can then list their piece for auction on an NFT marketplace, similar to eBay.

Digital art has long been undervalued, in large part because it’s so freely available. To help artists create financial value for their work, NFTs add the crucial ingredient of scarcity. For some collectors, if they know the original version of something exists, they’re more likely to crave the “AUTHENTIC” piece. Some digital art collectors say they’re paying not just for pixels but also for digital artist's labor in part, the movement is an effort to economically legitimize an emerging art form. The artist put so much work into it and it was sold for the price that it deserved. The movement is also taking shape after many of us have spent most of the past year online. If nearly your whole world is virtual, it makes sense to spend money on virtual stuff.

So-called whales are making the biggest deals in the NFT art world. These deep-pocketed investors and cryptocurrency evangelists stand to benefit financially from hyping anything remotely related to crypto. “A Winklevoss spending 700 grand on a Beeple or whatever is very much marketing spend for an idea that they are heavily invested in,” the technologist and artist Mat Dryhurst says, referring to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, two well-known cryptocurrency bulls who bought Nifty Gateway in late 2019 for an undisclosed amount.

The common misconception is that you can't display these in your home, but the vast majority of our consumers, digitally native consumers, is that they're in this so much for the takeaway, but what they're giving back. And that's what we're seeing, these record-breaking numbers. Collectors are coming to the table in a really big way for the sake of supporting artistry and the artists on our platform. And if nothing at all is accomplished but that's just a truly beautiful thing.

You could take a picture of the Mona Lisa, It doesn't mean that you own it. And I think the reason that everybody knows that you don't own the Mona Lisa just because you take a picture of it is that it has a social value around who owns it and that becomes respected. So I think within the respected NFT community, you are aware of who owns it through their profiles.

"It could be considered a concern, but no more a concern than somebody going to the Louvre and taking a picture of one of those pieces and then saying, 'I own this. This is mine'."
